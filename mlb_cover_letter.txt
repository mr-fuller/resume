Analyst, Baseball Data
Major League Baseball
New York, NY

Dear Analyst, Baseball Data (to whom this position reports),

As I scrolled Mike Petriello's twitter profile, yearning for more Statcast Content ever since the end of the Statcast (and later Ballpark Dimensions) podcast, I saw a retweet of this Seasonal Baseball Data Support Coordinator position posted by @shanna_shi and knew I had to apply. I already spend most summer nights watching baseball on one screen with the Statcast game feed up on another (unless I'm watching an alternate Statcast broadcast), so even though that's probably an oversimplification of the job requirements, it still barely even sounds like work, or at the very least the schedule requirements will not be an issue. 

But I have experience that should translate to the job requirements as well. As a Transportation Planner at TMACOG, I regularly responded to requests for data from the US Census Bureau, interpreting the arcane secrets of geographic FIPS codes to secure funding for local transportation projects worth millions of dollars or to establish an economic development district. For these grant and project applications, I use data to create the narratives.

I hope I have conveyed enough passion and proficiency to procure passage to the next phase of the process. You can contact me at mrfuller460@gmail.com or 6169530307. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Mike Fuller

P.S.

I was confused by the "Do you require relocation or are you local?" question and answered 'Yes, local' because I understand this position to be fully remote, so I don't think I will require relocation even though I am not local to New York.
